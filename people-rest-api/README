===========
Create a REST API that can create, read, update, and delete "People" using any of the Spring projects and an in-memory database for persistence.  Track your changes/progress using GitHub, and share the GitHub repository with us when you�re done.  For extra credit, add other REST API endpoints to group �People� into �Families.�  If you�re someone who always goes above and beyond, or thought that was too easy, optionally build a simple front end to add, update, delete and list the people.

Solution:

Based off the Accessing JPA Data with REST Spring data guide
http://spring.io/guides/gs/accessing-data-rest/
